## About Me

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at **Chung-Ang University**. I am also working as a research student at the **Machine INtelligence & Data Science (MINDS) Lab**, where I focus on developing machine learning methodologies that address complex, human-centric challenges. My primary objective is to design **socially responsible AI** models that directly impact real-world data issues.

My work is built upon two core, interconnected pillars:

1.  **Social Data Science:** I apply advanced data mining and **Graph Learning** techniques to analyze, model, and improve large-scale societal systems. A key focus is on **Social Network Analysis and Mining** to understand structural dynamics and develop strategies for **Polarization Mitigation**.

2.  **Responsible AI:** I am dedicated to ensuring that AI models are ethical, robust, and ready for deployment in sensitive contexts. My specific field of interest here is **Fairness in AI Models**, alongside working on model **Interpretability** and overall system **Robustness**.

I strive to bridge the gap between technical innovation and societal responsibility, building transparent, trustworthy, and impactful models.
