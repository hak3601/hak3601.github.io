### About Me
---
My research is centered on **Social Data Science**, focusing on the application of data mining and graph learning to analyze and improve complex societal systems.

I am an undergraduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at **Chung-Ang University**, working as Research Intern in the **Machine INtelligence & Data Science (MINDS) Lab**. My primary objective is to develop socially responsible machine learning methodologies that directly address real-world data challenges.

My core research theme involves creating **Responsible AI** models for social applications, with particular emphasis on:

* **Social Network Analysis and Mining:** Leveraging **Graph Learning** to understand the structure and dynamics of large-scale social systems.
* **Mitigating Social Polarization:** Developing data-driven strategies to analyze, detect, and reduce political and social fragmentation.
* **Trustworthy AI:** Ensuring models are robust, **fair**, and **interpretable** before deployment in social or data-driven contexts.

I aim to bridge the gap between technical innovation and societal responsibility, building transparent models applicable to complex human-centric data.
